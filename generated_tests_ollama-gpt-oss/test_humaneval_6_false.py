# Generated test cases:
We need to produce a corrected test file. The error shows that the test file contains a huge comment block that is not commented out. The test file currently contains a lot of explanatory text that is not commented out, causing syntax errors. We need to produce a clean test file that only contains imports and test functions. We cannot include the function implementation. We need to import parse_nested_parens from the module where it's defined. The test harness expects the function to be imported from solution. So we will import from solution import parse_nested_parens. We need to import pytest. Then we need to write test functions that test the actual behavior. We need to ensure that the test file is syntactically correct. We need to ensure that the test file is in the correct directory. The test file is located at generated_tests_ollama-gpt-oss/test_humaneval_6.py. The function parse_nested_parens is defined in the same file? Actually, the function is defined in the original code snippet. The test harness expects the function to be imported from solution. So we will import from solution import parse_nested_parens. Then we will write tests. We need to ensure that the tests reflect the actual behavior. We need to test various cases. We need to test that parse_nested_parens returns a list of integers. We need to test that the list length matches the number of groups. We need to test that the maximum depth is correct. We need to test that the function handles empty string, whitespace, etc. We need to test that the function handles nested parentheses. We need to test that the function handles groups separated by spaces. We need to test that the function handles groups separated by multiple spaces. We need to test that the function handles groups separated by spaces and other characters. We need to test that the function handles groups with non-parenthesis characters. We need to test that the function handles groups with unmatched parentheses. We need to test that the function handles groups with only parentheses.
